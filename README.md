# DiceAnalysis
Analyses data from a set amount of dice rolls and plots a graph

# Usage
If you want to change the amount of dice rolls, open the file and modify the 'ROLLS' variable.

# How
This is a simple program which rolls dice a set amount of times and analyses the data which those rolls produce 

It then forms a dataset (number -> frequency -> percentage) which is displayed in graphical form in the terminal using plotext

The process is also timed in case you are using this for testing system speeds (ex. time /1000 rolls)

# Note
This code can be optimised far more but I wanted it to look clean so that beginners can still understand it
